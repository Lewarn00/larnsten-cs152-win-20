1. How is a tree different from a linked list?
A tree is different from a linked list in that every node of a tree has a parent and can have multiple 
children, while a linked list is sequential with every element pointing to a single following element
in the defined order.


2. What are the two properties that define a binary search tree?
1) The key at a node must be greater than the keys in the left subtree and less than the 
keys in the right subtree.
2) The left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees. Each key must be unique.


3. What type do we use when we want it to be a pointer, but we don't want to restrict the type to which the pointer points?
You can use a void pointer to point to any type.

If you make an ordered data structure (e.g. sorted linked list or BST), you need to perform comparisons to sort the data. If you are implementing a generic data structure that is allowed to hold any type, you need to accept a compare function as an input. What is the signature / prototype of that function that will be passed in?
      d) void *compare(void *x, void *y);
