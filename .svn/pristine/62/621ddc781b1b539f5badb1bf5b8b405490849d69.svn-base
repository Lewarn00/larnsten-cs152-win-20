1. What are the properties that define a heap?
A max heap is a tree structure where the values of the left and right trees are less 
than the value of the root for all subtrees. The opposite is true for a min heap.

2. What functionality does a heap give up to obtain its performance guarantees?
There is no implied order between sibling nodes for an in-order traversal.

3. When implementing an abstract data type that is a container class, why is an iterator created rather than just letting a program write their own for loop that iterates through the structure?
Since there is no implied order bewteen sibling nodes the iterator must be created to ensure that 
the data type is looped through in the correct order.

4. When implementing an abstract data type that is a container class, why do we use void pointers and function pointers?
We use void and function pointers to allow for the tree to hold and compare data of any type.
