Welcome to mastermind. I am thinking of a 4-number
sequence. All four numbers are between 1 and 6.
You have 12 guesses to guess it correctly.
Each time you guess, I'll tell two things.
1. How many numbers are correct and in the correct position.
2. How many other numbers are correct but in the wrong position.
Let's get started!!!
solution: 5341
Guess 1 - Input your 4-digit guess: Feedback: 0 correct placement, correct color,
3 incorrect placement, correct color
Not quite - you still have 11 guesses left!
Guess 2 - Input your 4-digit guess: Feedback: 0 correct placement, correct color,
3 incorrect placement, correct color
Not quite - you still have 10 guesses left!
Guess 3 - Input your 4-digit guess: Feedback: 0 correct placement, correct color,
2 incorrect placement, correct color
Not quite - you still have 9 guesses left!
Guess 4 - Input your 4-digit guess: Feedback: 0 correct placement, correct color,
3 incorrect placement, correct color
Not quite - you still have 8 guesses left!
Guess 5 - Input your 4-digit guess: Feedback: 0 correct placement, correct color,
2 incorrect placement, correct color
Not quite - you still have 7 guesses left!
Guess 6 - Input your 4-digit guess: Feedback: 0 correct placement, correct color,
2 incorrect placement, correct color
Not quite - you still have 6 guesses left!
Guess 7 - Input your 4-digit guess: Feedback: 0 correct placement, correct color,
1 incorrect placement, correct color
Not quite - you still have 5 guesses left!
Guess 8 - Input your 4-digit guess: Feedback: 1 correct placement, correct color,
1 incorrect placement, correct color
Not quite - you still have 4 guesses left!
Guess 9 - Input your 4-digit guess: Feedback: 1 correct placement, correct color,
0 incorrect placement, correct color
Not quite - you still have 3 guesses left!
Guess 10 - Input your 4-digit guess: Feedback: 1 correct placement, correct color,
9 incorrect placement, correct color
Not quite - you still have 2 guesses left!
Guess 11 - Input your 4-digit guess: Feedback: 0 correct placement, correct color,

 ;; automated_correctness_subtotal_:		73/75

;; === 
;; partial credit returned via visual inspection - only for
;; problems on which you earned fewer points than you can get back.
;; if you got more than 0 points, then the partial credit is scaled.
;; look at code for grader notes if bugs identified

;; draw_hourglass_rec	-   
make sure no points are taken off for something that you can't see visually - 
like perhaps an extra space at the end of the line. That should restore
all points back.
+8 - only problem is systemic minor printing difficulty like extra line somewhere
+2 - draws something hourglass-ish in a recursive manner
				
;; draw_hourglass_iter	-   /

;; play_mastermind
;; if there are some visual mismatches, grade this way instead
take off once per category, not once per instance.
-0 - visual mismatch that is only extra line or spacing, nothing
   - against the requirements
-1 - minor mismatch that involves using a different printf than provided
-2 - doesn't print out the guess number properly
-2 - doesn't choose between Congratulations and not quite properly
-2 - doesn't print out feedback properly
-5 - doesn't ask for multiple guesses


;; if necessary, 10 pt charge for grader manually
;; getting code to run (as long as it was student error)

;; well-written purposes             1 / 4
GRADER: please write more descriptive purposes (e.g. with inputs, output, etc.)

;; proper indentation, line breaks   0 / 4
GRADER: -2 for lines > 80 chars (89, 90, 99, 100, 101, 102, 107-110, 166, 167, 192, 193,

;; well-named variables		     4 / 4
(i, j, k okay for simple loop counters. Meaningful names for others.)
;; adequate tests                   5  / 8
(for each function, tests that exercise pertinent functionality and error conditions)
GRADER: -3 for not automatically checking tests and just printing output/expected

;; === efficiency ===
;; good decisions for control structures 5 / 5
 -2 - inappropriate control structure (if/else where switch should have been)
 -2 - repeated function calls with same input and same result

;; === problem-specific requirements === 
;; Remove points from correctness testing if they don't use recursion when specified.
;; This refers to the recursive problems
